This project consists in creating a basic website using HTML.
It contains links to recipes.

**Note**: All the recipes are taken from the website (with some modifications): [AllRecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/).

Well, practically everything that was covered by the curriculum
from its beginning to this project lesson, i.e.
- Basic **HTML Elements**.
- Basic **Git Workflow**.

**Basic CSS Rules, CSS Properties and CSS Specificity**.
